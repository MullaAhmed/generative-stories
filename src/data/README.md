# Data Directory

This directory is used to store generated stories, simulation logs, and other output data from the Generative Stories system.

## Subdirectories

- `logs/` - Simulation logs and debug information
- `generated_stories/` - Complete generated stories in various formats
- `saves/` - Saved story states for continuation
- `exports/` - Exported story data for external use

## File Types

- `.json` - Story states, logs, and structured data
- `.txt` - Plain text story exports
- `.md` - Markdown formatted stories
- `.html` - Web-formatted story exports

## Usage

The system will automatically create subdirectories as needed. Generated files will be timestamped to prevent overwrites.
